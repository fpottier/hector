# Changes

## 2024/12/08

* The new submodule `Hector.IntArray` offers an implementation of
  integer arrays. These arrays are equivalent in functionality to
  ordinary arrays, but (because they are monomorphic) can be faster
  than ordinary arrays. This module is undocumented and may disappear
  in the future.

* Initial implementation and release.
