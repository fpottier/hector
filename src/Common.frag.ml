(* We use a subset of the functionality of the [Array] module, namely
   [length], [unsafe_get], [unsafe_set].

   Furthermore, we use [alloc], [make], [init], [sub], [blit]. We take
   these functions from a module named [A]. This allows them to be
   possibly redefined.

   We do *NOT* assume that [A.alloc n x] initializes every array slot
   with the value [x]. In fact, in this file, every call to [A.alloc]
   is of the form [A.alloc n dummy], where [dummy] is a dummy
