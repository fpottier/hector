   at hand. *)

  (* The logical length of the vector. *)
  mutable length   : int;

  (* The desired physical capacity of the vector. We impose the invariant
     [length = 0 || A.length data = capacity]. That is, unless the vector

(* We implement our own functions on arrays, so that [alloc], [unsafe_get],
   and [unsafe_set] are the only primitive operations on which we rely. *)

(* We add type annotations, where necessary, to ensure that our code is
   monomorphic. Thus, if the type [element] is [int], we avoid the test
   for float arrays, and we avoid the write barrier (_caml_modify). *)

module A = struct

  open Array

  (* To construct arrays, we use the factory functions provided the user,
     [X.alloc] and [X.make]. This allows the user to provide exotic (and
     possibly unorthodox) array construction methods. *)

  let alloc = X.alloc
  let make  = X.make

  (* We implement [init] and [sub] using [alloc], so that [alloc] is our
     single factory function for arrays. *)

  (* We implement just the special case of [blit] where there is no

  (* I have hesitated between using [Array.blit] and re-implementing it. One
     advantage of re-implementing it might be that [unsafe_set] is then our
     sole way of writing an array, so we can safely use truly initialized
     arrays (where an uninitialized slot contains arbitrary bits). But this
     seems too dangerous anyway. *)

  (* In the case of integer arrays, a loop can be 3 times faster than
     [Array.blit]. In the case of polymorphic arrays, a loop can be 30%
     slower than [Array.blit]. So, here, a loop seems advantageous if
     the code is specialized for a known immediate type; otherwise,
     using [Array.blit] is advantageous. *)
